    <p>I am a passionate Full Stack Web Developer located in NYC. I have been in love with technology since I was an adolescent. I loved fixing software problems for as far back as I can remember. I eventually started teaching myself programming because
      I was curious about it. I read a book called Head First Java and taught myself my first coding language. I wasn't sure where to go from there so I enrolled in a bootcamp to teach me Web Development, which was my primary interest. I am currently
      looking for a full-time position in the field.</p>

      <h3>Admin Panel</h3>
      <p>This is a basic admin panel for a school to manage their students, instructors and courses. Admins are able to assign students and instructors to courses and cohorts. They are also able to edit, delete and create new students, instructors, courses
        and cohorts.</p>
