    <p>I am a passionate Full Stack Web Developer located in NYC. I have been in love with technology since I was an adolescent. I loved fixing software problems for as far back as I can remember. I eventually started teaching myself programming because
      I was curious about it. I read a book called Head First Java and taught myself my first coding language. I wasn't sure where to go from there so I enrolled in a bootcamp to teach me Web Development, which was my primary interest. I am currently
      looking for a full-time position in the field.</p>
